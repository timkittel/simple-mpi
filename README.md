This is a minimal wrapper for `mpi` extracted from [`pyunicorn`](https://www.pik-potsdam.de/members/donges/software-2/software) with a small extension. It builds a basic master slave structure for parallelization using `mpi`. Please find details either in the [`pyunicorn`](https://www.pik-potsdam.de/members/donges/software-2/software) package or in the doc-string file [`simple_mpi/mpi.py`](https://github.com/timkittel/simple-mpi/blob/master/simple_mpi/mpi.py).

To install, close this directory
```
git clone https://github.com/timkittel/simple-mpi.git
